# Awesome Scalability, Availability, and Stability Back-end Design Patterns
[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A curated list of selected readings to illustrate Scalability, Availability, and Stability Design Patterns in Back-end Development.

#### What if your backend went slow?
> Understand your problems: performance problem (slow for a single user) or scalability problem (fast for a single user but slow under heavy load) by reviewing [design principles](#principles). You can also check some [talks](#talks) of elite engineers from tech giants (Google, Facebook, Netflix, etc) to see how they build and scale their systems.

#### What if your backend went down?
> "Even if you lose all one day, you can build all over again if you retain your calm!" - Thuan Pham, CTO at Uber Technologies Inc.
